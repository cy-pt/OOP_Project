# OOP_Project

This repository contains the final project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPolyU), developed in collaboration with two teammates.

We created a virtual file system that demonstrates fundamental OOP concepts, including abstraction, polymorphism, and inheritance.
