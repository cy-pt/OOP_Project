# OOP_Project

This repository contains the final project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPolyU), developed in collaboration with two teammates.

We created a virtual file system that demonstrates fundamental OOP concepts, including abstraction, polymorphism, and inheritance.

The source code and our project report are provided here for educational purposes only and may not be copied.
